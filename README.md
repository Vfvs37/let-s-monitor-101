***Solo challenge while Becode's boodcamp

> I'll let two Words doc as an attachement, the first one with a questions/answer for the first part (+ definitions for some notions), the other as a report of the second part.


  ## The Mission

One of the most important responsibilities a system administrator or SOC analyst have is monitoring the systems he manages. Indeed it's one thing to set them up and install software on them, but then what!? Well the next step is ensuring that the machines you provisioned as well as the services you deployed on them remain **available**, **reliable** and **secure**!
This challenge is divided in two tasks, the first one having you **research how to monitor** a Linux system as well as **what to look for** when doing so. You will have to **take note** of all your findings in a text file (EX: _markdown_) while being as **exhaustive** as possible (_what to monitor_, _how to monitor it_, _commands used_, _..._). Try to answer, but **don't limit yourself to**, the questions below to guide you through 
the research process:

- What are the main area of concern when monitoring a system? (EX: _CPU load_, _disk usage_, ...)
- How can you check what are the most memory intensive [running processes](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/p/process.htm) ?
- What are log files? Where can you fin them on a typical Linux system ?
- How can you check who where the last connected users, what they did, when they left ?
- What are the different metrics of health and performance of a system ?
- How can you check the uptime of a machine ?
- How can you assess the network traffic ?

The second task is meant to serve as practice and will have you, in a different file, **write a report** with as many relevant information (_what would make sense in a report_) as you can muster on a system you manage. It most preferably would be a remote machine, but it can also be your local machine as this is just practice.

**How to writing a report on the system you manage**
> i will put the steps to do it and show my work as an exemple for each point.




For the second part of the challenge, writing a report on the system you manage, here are some steps you can follow to organize your report:


1. Introduction:
   - Briefly introduce the system you manage.
   - State the purpose of the report and what you will cover.




2. System Description:
   - Describe the system's features, such as hardware, operating system, installed services, etc.
   - Provide an overview of the environment in which the system is used.



3. System Configuration:
   - Detail the software and hardware configuration of the system.
   - Mention installed software, versions used, and any specific configurations.



4. Security:
   - Explain the security measures in place on the system.
   - Mention firewall strategies, access permissions, security audits, etc.



5. Monitoring:
   - Describe the monitoring tools and techniques used to monitor the system.
   - Explain what is monitored, how it is monitored, and actions taken in case of issues.



6. Performance:
   - Provide information on the system's performance.
   - Include data such as CPU, memory, disk usage, etc.



7. Maintenance:
   - Describe regular maintenance procedures performed on the system.
   - Mention software updates, backups, cleaning tasks, etc.



8. Conclusion:
   - Summarize the key points of the report.
   - Provide recommendations for improvement or future management of the system.



9. Appendices (if applicable):
   - Include any relevant additional information, such as screenshots, scripts, monitoring reports, etc.

Once you have gathered all the necessary information, organize it logically and write your report following the above structure. Make sure to be clear, concise, and accurate in your writing.
